## Hi there 👋

<!--
**Priyanksu-Mandal/Priyanksu-Mandal** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on robotronics and developing IoT systems under the guidance of Prof. Anuj Grover at CPID, IIIT-Delhi
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in STM32 (C++) and ESP modules
-
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advanced embedded systems and real-world VLSI projects
- 💬 Ask me about embedded C++, Arduino, STM32, circuit design, and IoT systems

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an introvert and a slow learner — but I never stop learning!
